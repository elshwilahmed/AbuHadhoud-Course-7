Welcome to my repository for **Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 3** (Course 7) by **Eng. Mohamed Abu Hadhoud** (ProgrammingAdvices). This repo contains clean, optimized, and modular C++ solutions for all the problems in the course.

## 📚 About The Course
This level focuses heavily on **2D Arrays (Matrices)**, logical thinking, and manipulating data structures. The main topics covered include:
* **Matrices Manipulation:** Generating, printing, and modifying 3x3 (and dynamic) matrices.
* **Mathematical Operations:** Sum, Transpose, Multiply, and checking types of matrices (Identity, Scalar, Sparse, etc.).
* **Logical Puzzles:** Finding Min/Max, Palindrome Matrices, Intersecting numbers.
* **String Manipulation** (Later in the course).

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used
* **Language:** C++ (STL).
* **Data Structures:** `std::vector` (Dynamic 2D Arrays), Strings.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Modular Programming (Functions).
    * Pass by Reference vs Pass by Value.
    * Random Number Generation (`rand()`, `srand()`).
    * Memory Management (Basic).
    * Fast I/O Techniques.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each problem is solved in a separate `.cpp` file, named according to the problem topic/number.
